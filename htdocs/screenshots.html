<h3>Dolphin Demo</h3>

		<p>The @link:dolphin_demo@ was developed during the Summer of 2002
		to investigate a cheap reimplementation of a subset of the
		Udanax-Gold server and explorations into Xanadu UIs. The result is
		very rough, but starts to hint at some of the interesting features
		that come out of the basic design.</p>

				<tr>
						<td><a class="screenshot" href="dolphin-demo/documents.png">
					<img src="dolphin-demo/documents-small.png" alt="main window">
				</a></td>

	    <td>Simple Text editor that allows inserts, deletes and simple
	    transclusions, together with a list of known Works, and
	    associated Editions/Revisions. The first line of the text is
	    underlined to indicate it is part of a link, in this case a link
	    of type Title. The title link is used to populate the names of
	    the works seen in the top left Works pane.</td>

					</tr>

					<tr>
      <td><a href="dolphin-demo/comparison.png" class="screenshot">
					<img src="dolphin-demo/comparison-small.png" alt="document
							 comparison">
				</a></td>

	    <td>Comparison between the original edition of the work on the
	    right, and the latest on the left. The colors highlight sections
	    which are the <b>same</b> between the two editions. So the first
	    green section indicates <i>COPYRIGHT AND ...</i> is the same.
	    The Highlighting of <i>David G Jones</i> shows that it can be
	    found in the same location in the left edition, but has also
	    been transcluded/copied twice further down the edition. A
	    standard documentation/versioning system such as CVS would not
	    be able to connect together the copied <i>David...</i>s. Finally
	    <i>free of charge,</i> and <i>person</i> and the section in
	    capitals have been deleted in the new edition.</td>
