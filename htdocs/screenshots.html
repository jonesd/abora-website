      <h1>Abora Screenshots</h1>

      <p>Currently Abora is at such an early state of development it can't be used for productive
	work, but there is a simple text editor front-end/UI that can be used to explore the features.
	I have included a few screen shots below so you can get a flavour of it:</p>

      <p><img src="documents.gif"><br>
	    Simple Text editor that allows inserts, deletes and simple transclusions, together with
	    a list of known Works, and associated Editions/Revisions. The first line of the text is
	    underlined to indicate it is part of a link, in this case a link of type Title. The title
	    link is used to populate the names of the works seen in the top left Works pane.</p>

      <p><img src="comparison.gif"><br>
	    Comparison between the original edition of the work on the right, and the latest on the left.
	    The colors highlight section which are the <b>same</b> between the two editions. So the first green
	    section indicates <i>COPYRIGHT AND ...</i> is the same. The Highlighting of <i>David G Jones</i>
	    shows that it can be found in the same location in the left edition, but has also been transcluded/copied
	    twice further down the edition. A standard documentation/versioning system such as CVS would not
	    be able to connect together the copied <i>David...</i>s. Finally <i>free of charge,</i> and <i>person</i> and the section in capitals have been deleted in the new edition.</p>

      <p><img src="links.gif"><br>
	    Simple listing of all links that are associated with the content included in the edition.</p>

      <p><img src="transclusions.gif"><br>
	    List of all other works that share the same content as the current work. This can be
	    for all the text of the current work or just its current selection.</p>

      <p><img src="otreehtree.gif"><br>
	    Developer inspector to investigate Ent-like tree used to store the data for all editions
	    of a Work.</p>

      <p><img src="stats.gif"><br>
	    Developer statistics on the size and makeup of an Ent tree.</p>
