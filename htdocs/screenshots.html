      <h1>Dolphin Demo Screenshots</h1>

		<p>The following images are a series of screenshots from the
		<b>Dolphin prototype/demo</b> executable. This was developed
		during the Summer of 2002 to investigate a cheap reimplementation of
		a subset of the Udanax-Gold server and explorations into Xanadu
		UIs. The result is very rough, but starts to hint at some of the
		interesting features that come out of the basic design.</p>

		<p>Currently Abora-White, the main focus of development, is too
			early in its life to any where near producing interesting screenshots.</p>

	    Simple Text editor that allows inserts, deletes and simple
	    transclusions, together with a list of known Works, and
	    associated Editions/Revisions. The first line of the text is
	    underlined to indicate it is part of a link, in this case a link
	    of type Title. The title link is used to populate the names of
	    the works seen in the top left Works pane.</p>

      <p><img src="comparison.gif"><br>

	    Comparison between the original edition of the work on the
	    right, and the latest on the left. The colors highlight section
	    which are the <b>same</b> between the two editions. So the first
	    green section indicates <i>COPYRIGHT AND ...</i> is the same.
	    The Highlighting of <i>David G Jones</i> shows that it can be
	    found in the same location in the left edition, but has also
	    been transcluded/copied twice further down the edition. A
	    standard documentation/versioning system such as CVS would not
	    be able to connect together the copied <i>David...</i>s. Finally
	    <i>free of charge,</i> and <i>person</i> and the section in
	    capitals have been deleted in the new edition.</p>

      <p><img src="links.gif"><br>
	    Simple listing of all links that are associated with the content included in the edition.</p>

      <p><img src="transclusions.gif"><br>
	    List of all other works that share the same content as the current work. This can be
	    for all the text of the current work or just its current selection.</p>

      <p><img src="otreehtree.gif"><br>
	    Developer inspector to investigate Ent-like tree used to store the data for all editions
	    of a Work.</p>

      <p><img src="stats.gif"><br>
	    Developer statistics on the size and makeup of an Ent tree.</p>
