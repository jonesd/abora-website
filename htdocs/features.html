    <h1>Abora Features</h1>

    <p>This is primarily a collection of <b>future</b> features for Abora that is culled
      from my understanding of Xanadu, Udanax-Gold and other pieces on hypertext systems.</p>

     <p>The intent of this list is to both help with an overview of what the final implementati.on
    of Abora may grow into, and also to act as an indication of the current location on this road.</p>

    <p>. = Not Started<br />
      - = Started but not visible in the release<br />
      I = Initial implementation<br />
      O = Reasonable implementation<br />
      X = Finished</p>
