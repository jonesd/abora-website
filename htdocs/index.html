      <h1>Abora Hypertext Project</h1>

      <p>Abora is an ongoing project to implement a hypertext system
      based on xanalogical structures. It will support fine grained
      links, transclusion of content, user filtering of links and
      enable client-server and server-server distribution. This
      project is strongly based on the ideas of <a
      href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a>'s <a
      href="http://www.xanadu.com">Xanadu</a> and in particular the
      design, architecture and code of <a
      href="http://www.udanax.com/gold/">Udanax-Gold</a> by <a
      href="http://www.udanax.com/">XOC</a> which was released as
      open-source in 1999.</p>

			<p>This project is released under the MIT open-source license.
			Source development in Java and Dolphin Smalltalk is available.
			An executable prototype/demo for the MS Windows platform gives a
			flavour of one possible destination.</p>

		<p>The author has been working on this project in his spare time
		since late 2001, but due to the numerous changes in direction
		while trying to get an understanding of the XOC technologies there
		is <font color="red">still some way to go</font>. It is hoped that
		a usable subset of the functionality based on the new Abora-White
		code-base should be available for experimenting with Summer 2003.</p>


		<h3>Sub-Projects</h3>

		<p><b>Abora-White</b> is currently the main focus of attention and is
		a Java implementation of the Udanax-Gold server that has been
		auto-translated from the original Smalltalk, and then manually
		converted for a better fit into the Java world. Work is underway
		to incrementally port components of the original, write JUnit
		tests, JavaDoc and overview documentation.</p>

		<p><b>Udanax-Gold2Java</b> is a small throw-away application to
			auto-translate the Udanax-Gold Smalltalk source into approximate
			Java. The result has 1000's of compilation problems, but it is
			the basis for the Abora-White work.</p>

		<p><b>Dolphin Demo</b> is a Windows executable of a combined
			server and thick client that implements from scratch a limited
			subset of the Udanax-Gold capabilities. It supports fine grained
			links, versioning and differencing. Work has ceased for the
			moment while attention is focused on a Java implementation></p>
