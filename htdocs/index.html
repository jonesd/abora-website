      <h1>Abora Hypertext System</h1>

      <p>Abora is an ongoing project to implement a hypertext system
      based on a xanalogical structure.  It will support fine grained
      links, transclusion of content, user filtering of links and
      enable client-server and server-server distribution. This
      project is released under the MIT open-source license and source
      code for Dolphin Smalltalk is included. An executable demo for
      the MS Windows platform is available.</p>

      <p>It should be made clear up front that the Abora project is
	still in its <b>early days</b>, and even though there are executable
	demos it is probably in the order of six months before first
	pass versions of the bulk of the following features will be
	implemented. The well defined nature of the final feature set
	is courtesy of the forty years of research and development
	of the Xanadu system that this project is able to build on.</p>

      <h3>Why this might be interesting</h3>

      <p>At its simplest Abora could be seen as just another custom
      web site content-management system. Such systems are a dime a
      dozen, so what makes Abora interesting? The following gives a
	brief summary of some of the tasks and requirements that Abora
	will be able to help with:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Heavy re-working of documents - flexible version support,
	  visualization of changes and inclusion of shared content</li>
	  <li>Peer review of documents - 
	  categorised discussions on specific sections of content with user
	  filtering for manageability.</li>
			<li>Informal working groups - notification of document changes and new
				links enables spontaneous groups to form around specific
				documents as needed.</li>
	<li>Richly related documents - sophisticated linking and sharing of
				content between documents and versions enables a literature of
				works to be written and used.</li>
	<li>Distributed deployments - Multiple servers allows
	  documents to be replicated for performance, confidence and
	  easier access.
	<li>Secure and controlled document access - user and groups enable
	  flexible access to documents and integrated cryptography
	  improves confidence to authorship and uncorrupted contents.</li>
	<li>Long lived documents - document identity, sponsorship and
	  distributed garbage collection keeps documents in the system
	  as long as required which can continue to be found even after day-to-day modification.</li>
	  <li>Beyond text support - all the above capabilities can apply
	    to images, sound, movies and other arbitrary types of content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Xanadu and Udanax-Gold</h3>

      <p>This project is strongly based on the ideas of <a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a>'s <a href="http://www.xanadu.com">Xanadu</a> and in particular the design
	and architecture of <a href="http://www.udanax.com/gold/">Udanax-Gold</a> by <a href="http://www.udanax.com/">XOC</a>
	which was released as open-source in 1999.</p>

      <p>The author originally started working with the Udanax-Gold code
      released by XOC but found the missing components, overall complexity
      and lack of documentation to form too high a barrier for my
      available time. What I did find was a fascinating tree-based
      structure, The Ent, for storing versioned data and a series of
      interesting techniques for implementing transclusions, links,
      server loops, promises and other goodies.  Throwing caution to
      the wind I decide to start over from scratch as a learning
      exercise and to provide a base for the system that I had wanted
      for some time now. I was originally focused on a short holiday
      project to learn some more about a xanalogical system and what
      it would enable in comparison to the web, wiki-wiki and other
      systems, but I must confess that I have now been fully sucked
      into the vortex. </p>
      
      <p>The primary intention of Abora is to release an open-source
      version of a xanalogical server with cross-platform and language
      independent API which can support a Xanadu like Front-End/UI. I
      will continue releasing my own renditions of a Front-End,
      though I fear it will turn away from a suitable UI for
      most. Hopefully others will step in to fill the gap.</p>

      <h3>Xanalogical Features</h3>
      
      <p>The Abora core features are inspired by Xanadu and derive
      from the capabilities of the underlying Ent data
      structure as present in Udanax-Gold.</p>

      <ul>
	<li><b>Transclusions</b> or virtual-copies can be seen as a
	form of copying-and-pasting except that the pasted form is
	connected back to the original text so it is always possible
	to find the original author of any character of text, and all
	other documents that share the same content. This helps
	against the problems of quoting out-of-context, and taking
	benefit from some-one elses work without proper
	acknowledgement.</li>

	<li>Implemented on top of this is support for <b>fine-grained
	links</b> that are typed and can be navigated in both
	directions. Links can be stored separate from the content
	itself which enables anyone to annotate any other document
	that they can view. In combination with typed links this
	enables low-overhead commenting of original text and
	structured responses such as refutations, agreements,
	acknowledgements. Links can also be filtered by users to focus
	on comments from respected or specific viewpoints. This will
	be a critical feature once hundreds or thousands of links have
	been attached to a document.</li>

	<li><b>Coordinate space</b> mechanism allows content elements
	to be mapped over more sophisticated spaces than that of text
	or uncompressed audio. One possibility is the two dimensions
	of an image. This enables transclusions and links to work
	across these numerous spaces, for example just the eye of an
	image of a face could be transcluded into a separate document,
	and a destination of a link could be to a few seconds of a
	sound sample.</li>

	<li><b>Sensors</b> or detectors can be attached to objects to learn
	  when certain actions occur. Some examples includes detecting
	  when a new link is added to an interesting document, or when
	  a new edition of a document is made. This can enable the
	  spontaneous grouping of interested parties around a central
	  document that acts as focus for the work.</li>

	<li>These features are all tied into a <b>version system</b>
	that ensures links stay connected to their original content
	and transcluded text stays available. Modifications to
	documents are stored at the level of changes by the user, so
	between editions changes can be copying and moving in addition
	to the more primitive deletes and inserts that systems such as
	CVS would break changes down to.</li>

	<li>A significant force that shaped the Udanax-Gold design was
	the need for an implementation that could expand up to a
	<b>distributed system</b> comparable to todays
	World-Wide-Web. There is an interesting mix of mutable and
	immutable state that enables replication of data, together
	with idea of sponsors of documents and a distributed garbage
	collection system to enable that documents are only jettisoned
	when they aren't referenced anymore or no-one is prepared to
	provide sufficient space for it.</li>
      </ul>
	
      <h3>Downsides</h3>

      <p>The features summary lists a series of very interesting
	differences against the standard WWW and even the innumerable
	custom web-site implementations. Given all this good news,
	where should one be concerned?</p>

      <ul>
	<li><b>Complexity</b> of the implementation is significantly
	higher than was found during the birth of the WWW. This has
	implications both to the time it will take to write a
	production-grade version of the server, and on to the
	complexity and level of knowledge required by programmers that
	are interested in writing additional clients. Where as any
	programmer could wrestle up HTTP clients and servers, just
	writing a compatible Abora client will be a significant
	undertaking. Once the project has stabalized, producing well
	documented versions of the API with ample examples will be an
	important force on the greater success of the project.</li>

	<li><b>Server reliance</b> is a constraint on the use of
	clients. A client needs to be in relatively frequent
	communication with a server, both to find content, but also
	during modification of content as the server essentially acts
	as a repository and needs to be informed of higher level
	actions such as copying text between two locations. Contrast
	this to the use of CVS and a text editor; a CVS client is used
	to download a text document from the CVS repository, but then
	the text editor can make as many changes as it likes before
	eventually committing the new revision of the document back to
	the CVS server. It is only at this point that the server
	attempts to calculate the users changes, which will be encoded
	up as primitive actions such as inserts and deletes. The
	frequent Abora communication with server can be mitigated by
	running a server on each machine. The other effect though is
	that clients have to understand the Abora protocol, whereas
	the text editor knows nothing of CVS, as far as it is
	concerned it is just opening and saving text documents from
	the local filing text, and is obviously to the CVS client
	which moves files in and out of the external CVS server. An
	Abora client does have to know about Abora, and even with efforts to
	ease this communication with well documented APIs this will be
	a significant challenge to the uptake of the software.</li>

	</ul>

      <h3>Implementation</h3>

      <p>Abora is coded from scratch using <a
      href="http://www.object-arts.com">Dolphin Smalltalk</a>. This is
	a low cost, clean and compact implementation of the Smalltalk
	programming language for the MS Windows Platform. It was
	chosen due to the authors familiarity with it. The downsides
	are it's commercial nature and the lack of cross-platform
	execution. These limitations are present in the executable
	demo that is currently available.</p>

      <p>One of the longer term forces on the project is to ensure
      that the server is at least cross-platform capable and that
      development efforts can be undertaken using non-proprietary
      tools.  This will probably eventually push the server
      implementation to be translated to either <a
      href="http://www.squeak.org">Squeak</a> or a non-commercial
      flavour of VisualWorks. A second avenue may be to a language
      such as Java.</p>

      <p>Beyond the server will be a language independent API for
      clients to communicate with the server. The intention is to
      include support for the Smalltalk and Java languages with the
      main release, and hopefully interested parties may donate Perl,
      Python, etc implementations.</p>

      <h3>Assistance</h3>

      <p>If you would like to help in anyway then don't hesitate to get in contact. It is always
      difficult to keep a spare time project going, especially one which is going to take some time before
      it can be used by end-users for their own work.</p>
