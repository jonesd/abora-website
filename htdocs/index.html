      <h1>Abora Hypertext Project</h1>
<!-- abora:header_close -->

      <p>Abora is an ongoing project to implement a hypertext system
      based on xanalogical structures. It will support fine grained
      links, transclusion of content, user filtering of links and
      enable client-server and server-server distribution. This
      project is strongly based on the ideas of <a
      href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a>'s <a
      href="http://www.xanadu.com">Xanadu</a> and in particular the
      design, architecture and code of <a
      href="http://www.udanax.com/gold/">Udanax-Gold</a> by <a
      href="http://www.udanax.com/">XOC</a> which was released as
      open-source in 1999.</p>

			<p>This project is released under the MIT open-source license.
			Source development in Java and Dolphin Smalltalk is available.
			An executable prototype/demo for the MS Windows platform gives a
			flavour of one possible destination.</p>

		<p>The author has been working on this project in his spare time
		since late 2001, but due to the numerous changes in direction
		while trying to get an understanding of the XOC technologies there
		is <b>still some way to go</b>. It is hoped that
		a usable subset of the functionality based on the new Abora-White
		code-base should be available for experimenting with Summer 2003.</p>


		<h3>Sub-Projects</h3>

		<ul>

		<li><b>Abora-White</b> is currently the main focus of attention and
		is a Java implementation of the Udanax-Gold server that has been
		auto-translated from the original Smalltalk, and then manually
		converted for a better fit into the Java world. Work is underway
		to incrementally port components of the original, write JUnit
		tests, JavaDoc and overview documentation. [<font
		color="green">Ongoing</font>]</li>

		<li><b>Udanax-Gold2Java</b> is a small throw-away application to
		auto-translate the Udanax-Gold Smalltalk source into approximate
		Java. The result has 1000's of compilation problems, but it is the
		basis for the Abora-White work. [<font
		color="red">Complete</font>]</li>

		<li><b>Dolphin Demo</b> is a Windows executable of a combined
		server and thick client that implements from scratch a limited
		subset of the Udanax-Gold capabilities. It supports fine grained
		links, versioning and differencing. Work has ceased for the moment
		while attention is focused on a Java implementation. [<font
		color="#FFA500">Paused</font>]</li>
		
		<li><b>Udanax-Gold2Dolphin</b> is an attempt to load the
		Udanax-Gold source code into Dolphin Smalltalk, and get the
		supplied tests to work. Managed to get most of the tests to at
		least run a little. I know now that I messed up my 100% guess
		implementation of the missing PrimArray, so could do a lot better
		now. Source available on request. [<font
		color="#FFA500">Paused</font>]</li>
