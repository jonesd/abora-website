      <p><h1>Abora Hypertext System</h1></p>

      <p>Abora is an ongoing project to implement a hypertext system based on a Xanalogical Structure. 
	It will support fine grained links, transclusion of content, user filtering of links and enable
	client-server and server-server distribution. This project is released under the MIT open-source
	license and source code for Dolphin Smalltalk is included. An executable demo for the MS Windows
	platform is available.</p>

      <p>This project is strongly based on the ideas of <a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a>'s <a href="http://www.xanadu.com">Xanadu</a> and in particular the design
	and implementation ideas of <a href="http://www.udanax.com/gold/">Udanax-Gold</a> by <a href="http://www.udanax.com/">XOC</a> which was released as open-source in 1999.</p>

      <p>Abora is coded from scratch using <a href="http://www.object-arts.com">Dolphin Smalltalk</a>. This currently limits the project to the MS Windows platform, but once the code starts to reach a reasonable level ports to an open and cross-platform version of Smalltalk are planned.</p>

      <p>As you will quickly find out Abora's capabilities are currently very limited!</p>

      <p>If you would like to help in anyway then don't hesitate to get in contact. It is always
      difficult to keep a spare time project going, especially one which is going to take some time before
      it can be used by end-users for their own work.</p>
