      <p><h1>Abora Hypertext System</h1></p>

      <p>Abora is an ongoing project to implement a hypertext system
      based on a xanalogical structure.  It will support fine grained
      links, transclusion of content, user filtering of links and
      enable client-server and server-server distribution. This
      project is released under the MIT open-source license and source
      code for Dolphin Smalltalk is included. An executable demo for
      the MS Windows platform is available.</p>

      <h3>Udanax-Gold and Xanadu</h3>
      <p>This project is strongly based on the ideas of <a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a>'s <a href="http://www.xanadu.com">Xanadu</a> and in particular the design
	and architecture of <a href="http://www.udanax.com/gold/">Udanax-Gold</a> by <a href="http://www.udanax.com/">XOC</a>
	which was released as open-source in 1999.</p>

      <p>I originally started working with the Udanax-Gold code
      released by XOC but found the missing source, overall complexity
      and lack of documentation to form too high a barrier for my
      available time. What I did find was a fascinating tree-based
      structure, The Ent, for storing versioned data and a series of
      interesting techniques for implementing transclusions, links,
      server loops, promises and other goodies.  Throwing caution to
      the wind I decide to start over from scratch as a learning
      exercise and to provide a base for the system that I had wanted
      for some time now. I was originally focused on a short holiday
      project to learn some more about a xanalogical system and what
      it would enable in comparison to the web, wiki-wiki and other
      systems, but I must confess that I have now been fully sucked
      into the vortex. </p>
      
      <p>The primary intention of Abora is to release an open-source
      version of a xanalogical server with cross-platform and language
      independent API which can support a Xanadu like Front-End/UI. I
      will continue releasing my own renditions of a Front-End,
      though I fear it will turn away from a suitable UI for
      most. Hopefully others will step in to fill the gap.</p>

      <h3>Xanalogical Features</h3>
      
      <p>The Abora core features are inspired by Xanadu and derive
	from the capabilities of the underlying data
	structure. Transclusions or virtual-copies can be seen as a
	form of copying-and-pasting but the pasted form is connected
	back to the original text so it is always possible to find the
      original author of any character of text, and all other
	documents that share the same content. Implemented on top of
	this is the support for fine-grained links that are typed and
	can be navigated in both directions.</p>

      <h3>Implementation</h3>

      <p>Abora is coded from scratch using <a
      href="http://www.object-arts.com">Dolphin Smalltalk</a>. This
      currently limits the project to the MS Windows platform, but
      once the code starts to reach a reasonable level ports to an
      open and cross-platform version of Smalltalk are planned.</p>

      <p>As you will quickly find out Abora's capabilities are currently very limited!</p>

      <h3>Assistance</h3>

      <p>If you would like to help in anyway then don't hesitate to get in contact. It is always
      difficult to keep a spare time project going, especially one which is going to take some time before
      it can be used by end-users for their own work.</p>
