      <h1>Dolphin Demo Technical Documentation</h1>
<!-- abora:header_close -->

		<p>The implementation of the Dolphin Demo was driven out of a lack
		of appreciation of the features of Udanax-Gold, and definitely an
		understanding of how it could all be made to work. I had access to
		the source code released by XOC, but it was incomplete, and it's
		size defied easy interpretation. I found two critical papers on
		the @link:sunless_sea@ website that gave an overview of the Ent
		data structure, and the basic infrastructure for client
		developers.</p>

		<p>Starting from scratch as I did with the Demo forced me to gain
		some understanding of the core constraints and pressures on the
		design, and the learning about the design from the inside. I was
		not intending to implement a feature-by-feature clone of
		Udanax-Gold, but I did want to explore the basic features of a
		xanalogical data server and I did want to improve my knowledge of
		Udanax-Gold. As I progressed through a few iterations of the
		application later discoveries would reveal misunderstandings made
		early in the project. I often just drove straight on rather than
		rework the effected parts. This allowed me to cover more ground,
		but has left some rough edges and unexplored spaces.</p>

		<p>The majority of work on the Demo was accomplished during a two
		month summer holiday break. This was kindly green lighted by more
		employee, @link:intware@. Many thanks.</p>
