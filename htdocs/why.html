    <h1>Why Abora?</h1>

    <p>The World-Wide-Web has become the dominant hypertext system. If this is the case,
    then why is an application like Abora interesting? There is ample evidence from the features
    overlaying the out-of-the-box support of html as used by a series of websites:</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Slashdot to support reputations, </li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>MORE TO COME!</b></p>
