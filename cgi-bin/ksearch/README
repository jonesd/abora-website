This file contains general instructions on how to install and use KSearch.
For troubleshooting information go to our FAQs and Discussion Forum sites at:

INSTALLATION:

You will need a text editor, and access to your server to edit and run
scripts. If you want to index PDF files, you will need to install Xpdf 
from http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/. See faqs.html for details. Be sure 
that the appropriate permissions are set for each file/directory.

   (For Unix users)	(type at command line)          (type 'ls -l' for file list)
          read/exec	'chmod 755 filename'               -rwxr-xr-x
               read	'chmod 744 filename'               -rwxr--r--


1. (For Unix users) Be sure that the path to perl is correct on the first line
of indexer.pl and ksearch.cgi. To determine the path type 'which perl' at the
command line prompt. The path must follow '#!'. Default is '#!/usr/bin/perl'.

2. Change paramaters in the configuration file
'configuration/configuration.pl'.  All paramaters are explained in this file.

	You may have to add the full path to the configuration file in
	indexer.cgi, indexer.pl and ksearch.cgi where indicated.

	If you are going to use indexer.cgi, we recommend setting a password
	in the configuration file.

3. Add the full path of files you do not want to index in the ignore files
list 'configuration/ignore_files.txt' on separate lines.
(For Unix users) You can determine your current working directory (path) by
typing 'pwd' at the command line prompt.

4. Add terms you want the search engine to ignore in the stop terms list
'configuration/stop_terms.txt' on separate lines.

5. You may change the HTML template to match your web site design preference
by editing 'templates/search.html'. The end of 'search.html' has
descriptions of all the possible fields you may add to the template. By
default, all possible fields are added.

6. When you are finished with the configuration you can run the indexer
script to index your site. Type 'indexer.pl' or './indexer.pl' to run the
script. To run the indexer from a web browser, go to indexer.cgi in your browser. 
The time required will depend on the size of your site and your
server's CPU.

7. When you are finished indexing your site, you can use the search form
'search_form.html' as an example form and also to search your site.


Additional Info:

This search engine is designed to handle very large websites if configured correctly.
There is a tradeoff between search speed and disk space: if configured for
speed, this search engine will use more disk space.

To configure for speed (larger websites) change the following settings in
'configuration/configuration.pl':

1. $IGNORE_COMMON_TERMS = 90; Set this to the maximum percentage of files that indexed 
terms can exist in. This will remove common terms not present in 'stop_terms.txt'.

2. $SAVE_CONTENT = 1; Set this to 1 to index the processed contents of each file in the database.
If set to 0, the search engine will perform an on-the-fly search of all files. 

3. It is recommended to use DB_File. The search engine will be slightly faster. See below for details.


To configure to save disk space (smaller web sites) use the following settings in
'configuration/configuration.pl':

1. $IGNORE_COMMON_TERMS = 90; Set this to the maximum percentage of files that indexed 
terms can exist in. This will remove common terms not present in 'stop_terms.txt'.

2. $SAVE_CONTENT = 0; Set this to 0 to search on-the-fly. This could be extremely slow 
for large websites.

3. $MAKE_LOG = 0; Set this to 0 so you do not create a logfile of the
indexing routine.

DBM Issues:

This search engine relies on a Perl DBM database library to create the search
index and will automatically use the best available DBM database on your system.
SDBM is the standard library bundled with Perl, and has a limitation that may
effect the performance of the search engine. The SDBM, ODBM, and NDBM libraries
have block size limits (memory limits) that may terminate the indexing routine if
your site is too large.  If you have DB_File or GDBM_File, this will not be an
issue. Also, if you use "$SAVE_CONTENT = 1" and have DB_File or GDBM_File, the
search script will perform slightly faster because the data is stored in the DBM 
database instead of separate files. If SDBM, ODBM, or NDBM is used and you use 
"$SAVE_CONTENT = 1", the indexer will save the processed file contents to 
separate files to avoid memory limits. However, this does not prevent your chance 
to reach the block size limits if you have a very large site. For most sites, 
this will not be an issue.

If you receive the error:  

'dbm store returned -1, errno 28, key "trap" at - line 3.'

while running the indexer, you have reached the block size limit.
To fix this problem, you will need DB_File (install from CPAN) and the 
Berkley DB (http://www.sleepycat.com) or GDBM_File (install from CPAN).
We recommend DB_File.
